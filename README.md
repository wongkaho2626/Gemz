You are asked to implement the Gemz game (demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuhPvXbu5ZU) with the following additional requirements:

• Include a README page to describe the final set of rules of the game.

• The game board can have 2 different sizes. It can have 10 x 25 (regular) and 20 x 40 (large). A user should have an option to determine the size.

• The game stops if the maximum time exceeds or the user chooses to reset the game.

• There should be at least 5 levels with different time limit settings.
